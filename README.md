# .NET Firebase Rest Authentication API Client
A .NET API client for Firebase Authentication REST API that aims to follow the Google Firebase Auth API and documentation exactly.

The official documentation can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth/), and I link to the appropriate sections of Firebase's docs as we discuss the endpoints below.

**NOTE: This is a work in progress** - I'm currently only implementing the end points I need in my current projects. If you'd like to submit a pull request, please do!

## Getting Started

### Installation
You can add *firebase-auth-dotnet* to your solution by using Nuget (https://www.nuget.org/packages/Firebase.Auth.Rest)

On the command line use:
~~~~
dotnet add package Firebase.Auth.Rest
~~~~

In Nuget package manager use:
~~~~
Install-Package Firebase.Auth.Rest
~~~~

### Creating The API Service
The `FirebaseAuthService` class will contains all the endpoints that the Firebase Rest API offers. This class requires a `FirebaseAuthOptions` object to be passed through in it's constructor, which contians keys required to connect and authentiate with Firebase API.

~~~~
var authOptions = new FirebaseAuthOptions()
{
    WebApiKey = "<YOUR PROJECT'S WEB API KEY>"
}

var firebase = new FirebaseAuthService(authOptions);
~~~~

### Using .NET Core
If you are using **dotnet core**, you can configure this at the configuration level, so that `FirebaseAuthService` is injected into your classes automatically configured.

In your **Startup.cs** file you might do something like this.
~~~~
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var authOptions = Configuration.GetSection("AuthOptions").Get<AuthOptions>();
    services.AddScoped<FirebaseAuthProvider>(u => new FirebaseAuthProvider(new FirebaseConfig(authOptions.WebApiKey)));
}
~~~~
Then in your **appsettings.json** or your secrets configuration, add this.
~~~~
{
  "AuthOptions": {
    "WebApiKey": "<YOUR PROJECT'S WEB API KEY>"
  }
}
~~~~


# Endpoints


>**Only some endpoints are available (for now).**
>
>The SDK is currently being implemented on an endpoint by endpoint basis (as I need them).
All code examples use the `FirebaseAuthService` that we saw created in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section. 
> * [Sign up with email and password](#Sign-up-with-email-and-password)
> * [Sign in with email and password](#Sign-in-with-email-and-password)

>**You can follow Firebase's Official documentation in conjunction with this.**
>
>This client follows the official Firebase Auth Rest API documentation as closely as possible. Thus, for more detailed info there is a link for each endpoint to it's official documentation. 


>**Only Async method calls are supported** 
>
>All endpoints are implemented as standard .NET asynchronous methods.


## Sign up with email and password
>Creates a new email and password user.

|||
|-----|-----|
| **Firebase API Endpoint** | `signupNewUser` |
| **Request C# Type** | `Firebase.Auth.Payloads.SignUpNewUserRequest` |
| **Response C# Type**| `Firebase.Auth.Payloads.SignUpNewUserResponse` |
| **Endpoint Official Documentation** | [Go to Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth/#section-create-email-password) |

### Example
~~~~
var request = new SignUpNewUserRequest()
{
    Email = "valid@test.com",
    Password = "validpassword"
};

try
{
    var response  await firebase.SignUpNewUser(request);
}
catch(FirebaseAuthException e)
{
    // App specific error handling.
}

~~~~

## Sign in with email and password
>Signs an existing user in with their email and password.

|||
|-----|-----|
| **Firebase API Endpoint** | `verifyPassword` |
| **Request C# Type** | `Firebase.Auth.Payloads.VerifyPasswordRequest` |
| **Response C# Type**| `Firebase.Auth.Payloads.VerifyPasswordResponse` |
| **Endpoint Official Documentation** | [Go to Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth/#section-create-email-password) |

### Example
~~~~
var request = new VerifyPasswordRequest()
{
    Email = "valid@test.com",
    Password = "validpassword"
};

try
{
    var response  await firebase.VerifyPassword(request);
}
catch(FirebaseAuthException e)
{
    // App specific error handling.
}

## Unit Tests
Each endpoint comes with a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the SDK passes and receives data as expected per the documentation, as well as handles error circumstances.
### How to configure secrets.json for unit testing

It is expected by the test suite that a file called `secrets.json` exists in the root directory of the `Firebase.Auth.IntegrationTests` project. This file contains the secret keys needed to access Firebase for these integration tests.

There is a `.gitignore` file at the root of this project which prevents the `settings.json` file from accidently being committed to the repository with the secrets.
~~~~
{
  "firebaseWebApiKey": "<YOUR FIREBASE PROJECT'S WEB API KEY>",
  "validUserEmail": "<THE EMAIL OF A VALID USER>",
  "validUserPassword":  "<THE PASSWORD OF THE SAME VALID USER>",
  "validDisabledEmail": "<THE EMAIL OF A DISABLED USER>",
  "validDisabledPassword": "<THE PASSWORD OF THE SAME DISABLED USER>"
}

## Publishing Nuget Package
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/guides/create-net-standard-packages-vs2017

You'll need the MSBuild executable, likely located here:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin`

I generally add that to my path as I don't need any other version of MSBuild available on the command line.

The project has been set to generate a nuget packag on build, but to package manually, run this command from the `Firebase.Auth` project directoy.
~~~~
msbuild /t:pack /p:Configuration=Release
~~~~

Then, once you have the package, to push to nuget
~~~~
nuget push Firebase.Auth.Rest.1.0.1.nupkg -Source https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package
~~~~
