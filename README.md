# firebase-auth-dotnet
A dotnet standard2.0 SDK for Firebase Authentication that aims to follow the Google Firebase Auth API exactly, as per the official documentation - https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth/.

**This is a work in progress** - I'm currently only implementing the end points I need in my current projects. If you'd like to submit a pull request, please do!

## Getting Started
The `FirebaseAuthService` class will contains all the endpoints that the Firebase Rest API offers. This class requires a `FirebaseAuthOptions` object to be passed through in it's constructor, which contians keys required to connect and authentiate with Firebase API.

~~~~
var authOptions = new FirebaseAuthOptions()
{
    WebApiKey = "<YOUR PROJECT'S WEB API KEY>"
}

var authService = new FirebaseAuthService(authOptions);
~~~~

If you are using **dotnet core**, you can configure this at the configuration level, so that `FirebaseAuthService` is injected into your classes automatically configured.

In your **Startup.cs** file you might do something like this.
~~~~
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var authOptions = Configuration.GetSection("AuthOptions").Get<AuthOptions>();
    services.AddScoped<FirebaseAuthProvider>(u => new FirebaseAuthProvider(new FirebaseConfig(authOptions.WebApiKey)));
}
~~~~
Then in your **appsettings.json** or your secrets configuration, add this.
~~~~
{
  "AuthOptions": {
    "WebApiKey": "<YOUR PROJECT'S WEB API KEY>"
  }
}
~~~~

## Endpoints
The SDK is currently being implemented on an endpoint by endpoint basis, with the following Firebase Auth endpoints having been implemented thus far.

The example code follows on from the instantiation of the `FirebaseAuthService` that we saw in the Getting Started section.

### [Sign up with email / password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth/#section-create-email-password)

| Request Type    | Response Type           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| SignUpNewUserRequest      | SignUpNewUserResponse |

~~~~
var request = new SignUpNew
~~~~

## Unit Tests
Each endpoint comes with a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the SDK passes and receives data as expected per the documentation, as well as handles error circumstances.
### Firebase.Auth.IntegrationTests

#### secrets.json
It is expected by the test suite that a file called `secrets.json` exists in the root directory of the `Firebase.Auth.IntegrationTests` project. This file contains the secret keys needed to access Firebase for these integration tests.

There is a `.gitignore` file at the root of this project which prevents the `settings.json` file from accidently being committed to the repository with the secrets.

{
  "firebaseWebApiKey": "<YOUR FIREBASE PROJECT'S WEB API KEY>",
  "validUserEmail": "<THE EMAIL OF A VALID USER>",
  "validUserPassword":  "<THE PASSWORD OF THE SAME VALID USER>",
  "validDisabledEmail": "<THE EMAIL OF A DISABLED USER>",
  "validDisabledPassword": "<THE PASSWORD OF THE SAME DISABLED USER>"
}
